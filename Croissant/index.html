    <h2>Croissant Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The ancestor to the modern-day croissant is the "Kipferl", which hails from Austria.</li>
        <p>Culinary experts agree that the prototype of the modern-day croissant is the ‚Äúkipferl‚Äù, which first appeared in Austria in the 13th century. Kipferl are small, curved, sweet pastries mostly made from yeast dough. They taste more like bread rolls and due to the lack of lamination (the process of folding and rolling butter into dough over and over again to create super-thin layers), don‚Äôt possess the characteristic flaky texture of croissants that is so loved today. </p>
        <br>
        <li>The origin of the croissant is one of the great food legends of all time</li>
        <p>The history of croissants is literally the stuff of legend.  One often-told story tells that the croissant was concocted by a Viennese baker after the city defeated the Ottoman army at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. To commemorate the city‚Äôs victory over the Ottoman Turks, the baker created a special pastry in the shape of a crescent moon, a symbol of Islam and the Ottoman flag. Thus, each bite of the pastry would be a symbolic expression of the Ottoman‚Äôs crushing defeat. A similar story is told in Hungary, albeit with Budapest as the setting. Food historians dispute both versions and as food historian Jim Chevallier notes, the crescent pastry made by the baker would have been a kipferl, not a croissant.</p>
        <br>
        <li>Marie Antoinette did not popularize the croissant</li>
        <p>Popular legend credits the French Queen and Austrian native, Marie Antoinette (1755-1793) with introducing the kipferl, and thus the croissant, to France. Homesick for the taste of her native Vienna after her marriage to King Louis XVI of France, it is said that she introduced the kipferl to Versailles when she asked the court bakers to make her the sweet pastry. However, food historians see no evidence to support this notion and agree that the baked good only became popular in France during the 19th century.</p>
